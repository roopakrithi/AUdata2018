wheat,gannam/kanak,winter,self,"well drained, dry soil",too much rain in late season; wind storms,medium,"monkeys and boar when ripe, ungulates throughout"
barley,jow,winter,fodder,"well drained, dry soil",,low,boar sometimes
garlic,lasun,winter,cash,"well drained, dry soil",too much rain in late season,low,low for all species
potato,alu,summer,cash,"well drained, dry soil",too little or too much rain,high,"monkeys, especially a bit later in the season once potatoes have grown a bit. Boar as well. "
corn,chhalli/makki,summer,self,"well drained, dry soil",wind storms,high,corn is both more succeptible and more difficult to protect because monkeys can very effectively hide in high stalks late in the season as ears mature
kidney beans,rajma,summer,self/cash,"well drained, dry soil",,medium,not a huge problem with any particular species
radish,mooli,summer (monsoon),cash,some moisture,,medium,"not totally sure. Tend to be grown very close to homes, often fenced, and also in smaller quantities, so not entirely certain what's happening here. "
cabbage,gobi,summer (monsoon),cash,plenty of water,,medium,ditto as radish
peas,mattar,summer (monsoon),cash,"high elevation, very well drained",,high,especially succeptible to monkeys
string beans,french beans,summer (monsoon),cash,plenty of water,,medium,ditto as radish
rice,dhaan,summer,self,"plenty of water, flat gound",too little moisture where rainfed,low,"some boar loss, less monkey loss. Ungulates in theory don't go after rice as much (but none of my sites grow both rice and have ungulates)"
mustard,sarson,winter,self,dry ,too much moisture,v. low,one of the crops grown if you want to invest minimal time in protection
Kodo millet,kodra/mandal,summer,self,?,,v. low,"only in Garaman (so only know about interaction with monkeys). even if they monkeys eat the main product, the grass is really good for cows and they consider it especially good for making good quality milk."
fodder grass,ghas,summer,fodder,"dry, but flexible",,v. low,very low losses to all species; genreally a good option if you don't want to invest in protection but still want some crop output. 
Pearl millet? Sorghum?,chari bajra,summer,fodder,"dry, but flexible",,v. low,very low losses to all species; genreally a good option if you don't want to invest in protection but still want some crop output.

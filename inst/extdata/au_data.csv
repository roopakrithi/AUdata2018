As in, intentionally sowing both together. As best as I can tell, they cut the grass when it's reasonably long to use as feed. I got some complicated explanations of why they do this, but the ebst answer I got was that planting with grass is a bit of a deterrent to sambar and nilgai when the ears just start to appear.
